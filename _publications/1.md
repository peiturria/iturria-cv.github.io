802.11ax"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1
excerpt: 'IEEE 802.11ax introduces several amendments to previous standards with a special interest in spatial reuse (SR) to respond to dense user scenarios with high demanding services. In dynamic scenarios with more than one Access Point, the adjustment of joint Transmission Power (TP) and Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) threshold remains a challenge. With the aim of mitigating Quality of Service (QoS) degradation, we introduce a solution that builds on meta-learning and multi-arm bandits. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can adapt with an average of 1250 fewer environment steps and 72% average improvement in terms of fairness and starvation than a transfer learning baseline.'
